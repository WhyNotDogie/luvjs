# luvjs  
A way to write Love2D games in javascript or typescript.  
## Installation
```shell
npm install luvjs
```
## Quick start
```js
//this will be added
```
## Love2D
luvjs is based off of [Love2d](https://love2d.org).  
You should check it out! Its a free and open source [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html) game framework,
with a busling community. You can find it at [https://love2d.org](https://love2d.org).

## Why luvjs?
Love2D is good, but it lacks the power of features of node/javascript/typescript such as the many NPM packages,
http/https, the robustness of typescript, and so on.

## Contribuiting
Clone the repo:  
```shell
git clone https://github.com/WhyNotDogie/luvjs
```

Now issue a push request, and voila!
